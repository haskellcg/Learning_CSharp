## Framework overview
  * mascorlib.dll(multi-language standard common object runtime library): built-in types, basic collection classes, types for stream processing, serialization, reflection, threading, native interoperability
  * System.dll, System.Xml.dll, System.Core.dll: XML, networking, LINQ

## ADO.NET
  * ADO.NET is the managed data access API, although the name is derived from the 1990's ADO (ActiveX Data Objects), the technology is completelt different. ADO.NET contains two major low-level components: Provider layer, Dataset layer
  * Sitting above the provider layer are three APIs that offer the ability to query databases via LINQ: Entity framwork, Entity framework Core, LINQ to SQL

## Windows workflow
  * [Workflow foundation Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Workflow_Foundation)
  * a framework for modeling and managing potentially long running business process. Workflow targets a standard running library, providing consistency and interoperability.
  
## WCF - Windows Communication Foundation

## String.Format and composite format string
  * the embedded variables can be of any types, the Format simly calls ToString on them
  * the master string that includes the embedded variables is called a **composite format string**.
  ```
  string composite = "it's {0} degrees in {1} on this {2} morning";
  string s = string.Format(compiste, 35, "Perth", DataTime.Now.DayofWeek);
  ```
  * we can use interpolated string literal to the same effect, just string with $ symbol and put the expressions in braces
  ```
  string s = $"it's hot this {DataTime.Now.DayofWeek} morning"
  ```
  * format item, comma and a minimum width, colon and a format string
  ```
  string composite = "Name={0, -20} Credit Limit={1, 15:C}"
  ```
  
## StringBuilder
  * represent a mutable string. With a StringBuilder, you can Append, Insert, Remove, and Replace substrings without replacing the whole StringBuilder
  
## Text Encoding and Unicode
  * a character set is an allocation of characters, each with a numeric code or code point
  * a text encoding maos characters from their numeric code point to a binary representation. In .Net, test encodings come into play primaryly when dealing with text files or streams
  * there are two categories of test encoding in .Net
    * those map Unicode characters to another character set
    * those use standard Unicode encoding schemes
  * UTF-8 is the most space-efficient for most kind of text, it uses between 1 and 4 bytes to represent each character. The first 128 characters require only a single byte, make it compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the most popular encoding for text files and streams, and it's the default for stream I/O in .NET
  * UTF-16 use one or two 16-bit words to represent each characters, and is what .NET uses interbally to represent characters and string. Some programs also write files in UTF-16
  * UTF-32 is the least space-efficent, it maps each code point directly to 32 bits, so every character consume 4 bytes. It make random access very easy because every characters takes an equal number of bytes

## UTF-16 and surrogate pairs
  * some Unicode characters requires two chars to represent. This has a couple of consequences: A string's Length property may be greater than its real character count, A single char is not always enough to fully represent a Unicode character
  * Two-word characters are called surrogates. They are easy to spot because each word is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF
  ```
  string ConvertFromUft32(int utf32);
  int ConvertToUtf32(char highSurrogate, char lowSurrogate);
  
  bool IsSurogate(char c);
  bool IsHighSurrogate(char c);
  bool IsLowSurrogate(char c);
  bool IsSurrogatePair(char highSurrogate, char lowSurrogate);
  ```

## DateTime and DateTimeOffset
  * a DateTime incorporates a three state flag indicating whether the DateTime is relative to the local time/UTC(Greenwich Mean Time)/Unspecified
  * a DateTimeOffset is more specific, it stores the offset from UTC as a TimeSpan

## Formatting and Parsing
  * Formatting means converting to a string, parsing means converting from a string
  * ToString, Parse
  * Format Provider
  ```
  int minusTwo = int.Parse("(2)", NumberStyles.Integer | NumberStyles.AllowParenthess);
  ```
  * XmlCovert
  * Type converters
  * IFormatProvider, ICustomFormatter
  ```
  public class WordyFormatProvider: IFormatProvider, ICustomFormatter
  {
    static readonly string []_numberWords = "zero one two three four five six seven eight nine minus point".Split();
    
    IFormatProvider _parent;
    
    public WordyFormatProvider(): this(CultureInfo.CurrentCulcure)
    {
    }
    
    public WordyFormatProvider(IFormatProvider parent)
    {
      _parent = parent;
    }
    
    public object GetFormat(Type formatType)
    {
      if (formatType == typeof(ICustomFormatter))
      {
        return this;
      }
      else
      {
        return null;
      }
    }
    
    public string Format(string format, object arg, IFormatProvider prov)
    {
      if (arg == null || format != "W")
      {
        return string.Format(_parent, "{0:" + format + "}", arg);
      }
      else
      {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        string digilist = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0}", arg);
        foreach (char digit in digilist)
        {
          int i = "0123456789-.".Indexof(digit);
          if (-1 == i)
          {
            continue;
          }
          if (result.Length > 0)
          {
            result.Append(' ');
          }
          result.Append(_numberWords[i]);
        }
        
        return result.ToString();
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Globalization
  * there are two aspects to internationalizing an application and localization
  * Globalization is concerned with thress tasks
    * making sure that your program doesn't break when run in another culture
    * respecting a local culture's formatting rules, for instance, when displaying dates
    * designing your program so that it picks up culture specific data and strings from satelite assemblies that you can later write and deploy
  * Localization means concluding that last task by writing satellite assemblies for specific cultures. This can be done after writing your program
  * you can test against diffirent cultures by reassigning Thread's CurrentCulture property
  ```
  Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("tr-TR");
  ```

## Enum
  * Enum conversions
  ```
  [Flags]public enum BorderSides {Left = 1, Right = 2, Top = 4, Bottom = 8}
  
  int i = (int)BorderSides.Top;     //i == 4
  BorderSides side = (BorderSides)i;
  
  static object GetBoxedIntegralValue(Enum anyEnum)
  {
    Type integralType = Enum.GetUnderlyingType(anyEnum.GetType());
    return Convert.ChangeType(anyEnum, integralType);
  }
  
  static string GetIntegralValueAsString(Enum anyEnum)
  {
    return anyEnum.ToString("D");
  }
  ```
